# OpenAbility.ImGui.Nodes
This is an open-source, OOP-based approach to a node editor written in C# for 
Dear ImGui(specifically, ImGui.NET)

The project is currently in-development, and is not quite ready for production, but
feel free to use it for small side-projects or contribute to it!

It should run on any platform which is supported by ImGui.NET, or if you bring your
own natives, any platform supported by cimgui.
